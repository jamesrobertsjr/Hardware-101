# Arduino Challenges

Here are some programming challenges you can try as you continue to explore how to use your Arduino!

## Beginner

### Button Light Toggle

Write a program to toggle the LED light on and off using a button press.

**Requirements:**

The light should begin in an off state. When the button is pressed, the light should turn on and stay on until the button is pressed a second time. The light should toggle on and off with each button press.

**Solution:** [Button/Light Toggle Program](/programs/Button_Sketch_2.ino)

## Intermediate

### Chiptunes

[Chiptunes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiptune), also known as 8-bit music or chip music, are the synthesized sounds made famous in arcades and other video games. Find a song you like and create a chiptune version using the Arduino.

**Requirements:**

Write a program that plays a chiptune song. The program should define the frequencies and durations of the notes in the song and then play them when a button is pressed.

**Example:** [The Lost Forest](/programs/Buzzer_Sketch_2.ino)
